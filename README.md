# Flapp

This Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) App is responsible of gathering data values from different arduino-based sensors.
At the moment the app is designed for it to communicate with 5 types of water-sensing sensors:
```
pH Sensor
EC Sensor
Pressure Sensor
Weight Sensor
Temperature Sensor
```
All this sensors can be connected at the same time and after finishing the experiment, be sent in .csv format to any e-mail address or saved in the internal mobile phone/tablet memory.

# App Usage Instructions
When the app is opened you see an empty screen where you can search new device by clicking in the magnifying glass icon.



When you click the magnifying glass all the BLE available devices are shown. In this example we click on "PH" to conect to pH Sensor.

_maybe device will ask a pin number if it's first time being paired. try 000000 (six times zero) or 1234 in case of weight sensor_

Once device is connected, see the data being received in Data Display:

User can just watch the real-time sensor data values or Start a New Project to save the data for a period of time. Also user can adjust the interval in which the app will record the data values and also assign a project name:

When New Project's duration is over or button "Stop" is pressed, user will have the choice of sharing the data over e-mail or saving into the internal mobile memory:

If Share is selected the app will bring up the default mail app and will compress the .csv file to be sent:

Once data is shared user will be able to see a table-formated .csv file:
